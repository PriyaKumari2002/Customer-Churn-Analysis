# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling process to identify key characteristics of customers likely to churn. Using these insights, a predictive model has been built and deployed as a web application.

🚀 Project Overview

🔹 EDA: Analyzed customer data to identify churn patterns.
🔹 Model Building: Developed a predictive model using identified features.
🔹 Model Deployment: Integrated the model into a Flask-based web app.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
	•	Flask (For model deployment)
	•	Jupyter Notebook (For EDA & Model Building)
	•	HTML & CSS (For front-end UI)
